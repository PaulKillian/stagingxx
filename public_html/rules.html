            <br>

      Each of the Creator’s Posts will be available through the Entry Period (as stated in section 2 above). 
            <br/>
      Posts submitted by Entrants as entries in this Sweepstakes shall be referred to collectively as “Posts.” Sponsor reserves the right to remove any Post which is not related to the Sweepstakes or does not comply with the entry requirements or violates the Content Guidelines. The individual that posts the Post will be considered the Entrant for purposes of this entry method. Sponsor may not receive entries that fail to strictly follow the posting instructions set forth in these Official Rules, and Sponsor is not responsible for failure to see or receive an entry. Posts not received by Sponsor will not be entered into the Sweepstakes. For purposes of this Sweepstakes, Entrant’s posting will be deemed acceptance of these Official Rules. To qualify as an eligible entry, the Entrant’s Post must comply with the requirements set forth in these Official Rules, including, without limitation, the Content Guidelines set forth below.
            <br/>
            <br>
      <strong>Limit on Number of Entries:</strong> Only one Twitter entry per Creator Post is permitted, per Entrant. 
            <br/>
            <br />
        <strong>4. GENERAL ENTRY PROVISIONS:</strong> Attempts made by the same individual to submit multiple entries by using multiple or false contact information or using multiple accounts or otherwise may be disqualified. Entries generated by a script, computer programs, macro, programmed, robotic or other automated means are void and may be disqualified. Entries that are in excess of the stated limits, incomplete, illegible, corrupted, damaged, destroyed, forged, false, lost, late or misdirected, deceptive or otherwise not in compliance with the Official Rules may be disqualified from the Sweepstakes, at Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion. Entries submitted by Entrants who do not meet the eligibility requirements (including all requirements with respect to age and residence) are void. Those who do not follow all of the instructions or abide by these Official Rules or other instructions of Sponsor may be disqualified. Sponsor may not receive entries that fail to strictly follow the posting instructions set forth in these Official Rules and Sponsor is not responsible for failure to see or receive an entry.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        Entries that do not meet the following <strong>“Content Guidelines”</strong> are subject to disqualification, at Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion:
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (a) Entry submissions (“Submissions”) must comply with the Official Rules and the terms of service, privacy notice and/or other applicable rules set forth on Twitter (as applicable to an Entrant’s entry) and meet all specifications or requirements called for in the advertising for the Sweepstakes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (b) Except for materials that are in the public domain, each Submission, in its entirety, must be a single work of original material created by the Entrant and suitable for presentation in a public forum.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (c) Submissions must not have been submitted previously in any contest or sweepstakes of any kind or exhibited or displayed publicly (i.e., disclosed beyond your immediate circle of friends and family) through any means previously.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (d) Except for materials in the public domain, Submissions must include only materials created by the Entrant and must not infringe on the intellectual property rights of any other person or entity. Sponsor does not permit the infringement of others’ rights and any use of materials not original to the Entrant is grounds for disqualification from the Sweepstakes.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (e) Submissions must not include material that: (a) is sexually explicit, indecent, obscene, violent, hateful, tortious, defamatory, slanderous or libelous, (b) is derogatory or promotes bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against any group or individual or promotes discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age, (c) invades the privacy or publicity rights of any person, living or deceased, (d) is unlawful, (e) is harmful to other users of the website utilized by Entrant such as viruses, Trojan horses or other technologies that could adversely impact the Sweepstakes, and/or (f) is disparaging to Sponsor or is inconsistent with the positive images and/or goodwill to which Sponsor wishes to associate (at Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion).
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (f) Each Submission should not reveal any personal information about another individual, including another person’s address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (g) Entrant must have prior written permission from any individuals that appear in their Submission (e.g., family members, friends). For each Submission that identifies or depicts any person other than the Entrant, the Entrant must have obtained prior to submission such person’s written consent, or in the case of a minor, the written consent of his/her parent or legal guardian, to the use by the Sponsor of the photograph including such person’s name, image and/or other identifying information, as applicable, as permitted hereunder.
              <br/>
              <br/>
        (h) Entrants must not submit a Submission that, if selected as a winner, cannot be licensed or assigned to Sponsor as contemplated below.

      <strong>5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:</strong> Entrants, upon entry in the Sweepstakes, hereby irrevocably grant to the Sweepstakes Entities, and each of their licensees, successors and assigns, a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, no-cost license and right to use and otherwise exploit the Submissions submitted as part of the Sweepstakes, and all images, text and materials depicted therein, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium now or hereafter known or devised (including, without limitation, CDs, streaming media, film, television, videocassettes, print, interactive devices, mobile media, Internet and on-line systems), throughout the universe and in any and all languages, including, without limitation, the right to display, reproduce, record, perform, exhibit, distribute, copy, edit, change, modify, add to, subtract from, re-title and adapt the same, to combine it with other material and otherwise use and exploit it without having to give any compensation or attribution to Entrants except for the awarding of the prizes in this Sweepstakes. The Sweepstakes Entities, and each of their successors, assigns and licensees, will have the right to make unlimited derivative works therefrom, to assign or transfer any or all of their rights hereunder and to grant unlimited, multiple- level sublicenses. Without limiting the forgoing, the Sweepstakes Entities will have the right to use the Submissions submitted as part of the Sweepstakes, and all images depicted therein (if any), in any merchandising, advertising, marketing, promotion or for any other commercial or non-commercial purpose. Entrants hereby forever waive and relinquish all so-called “moral rights (droit moral)” now or hereafter recognized in connection with Submissions submitted as part of the Sweepstakes. Entrants acknowledge that as a condition of participating in the Sweepstakes and/or being selected as a winner, the Sweepstakes Entities may request that the Entrant’s Submission, and any rights therein, be assigned to them and Entrants may be required to confirm such assignment by completing and submitting the Affidavit (and any other documents reasonably required by Sponsor) or such Entrant will otherwise be disqualified from receiving their prizes. Entrants must maintain the ability to assign all such rights to Sponsor free of any limitations, restrictions or third party obligations. Entrants agree that the Sweepstakes Entities shall have the sole discretion in determining the extent and manner of use of Submissions and are not obligated to use any Submission. Entrants agree that neither the Sweepstakes Entities, nor its agents, shall be responsible for return or preservation of the Submissions submitted.

            <br/>
            <br/>
      Each Entrant acknowledges that other Entrants may have created ideas and concepts contained in their Submission that may have familiarities or similarities to his/her own Submission, and that he/she will not be entitled to any compensation or right to negotiate with the Sweepstakes Entities because of these familiarities or similarities. Notwithstanding any custom and practice to pay an individual for an idea (if any), nothing herein shall create an implied or express contract to compensate Entrants for their Submissions and there is no obligation for any Sweepstakes Entity to pay or otherwise compensate Entrants for any of their ideas or materials in any communications with Sponsor, whatsoever. Each Entrant, by participating in the Sweepstakes, except where legally prohibited, grants permission for the Sweepstakes Entities and each of their designees to use his/her name, social media site username, photograph, and/or other likeness in connection with the distribution of his/her Submission for advertising, trade and promotional purposes without further compensation, in all media now known or hereafter discovered, worldwide in perpetuity, without notice or review or approval. Sponsor reserves the right to request from Entrant at any time proof that Entrant maintains all necessary rights in their Submission in order to grant Sponsor the rights required herein in a form acceptable to Sponsor. Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the Entrant being disqualified from the Sweepstakes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      <strong>6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTY & INDEMNITY:</strong> Each Entrant represents and warrants that he or she has read, understands and will follow the Official Rules. Entrants further represent and warrant that their Submission and all materials and matter therein: (a) (except for elements that are within the public domain) are wholly original with such Entrant and are not a copy or imitation of any other material; (b) will not infringe or violate any right whatsoever, including, without limitation, any personal rights (e.g., defamation, privacy, false light, moral right, etc.) or any property rights (e.g., copyright, trademark, right to ideas, etc.) of any person or entity and the use thereof will result in no third party liability or obligations; and (c) is not the subject of any threatened or pending litigation, claim or dispute that might give rise to litigation, which adversely affects or in any way prejudices, impairs or diminishes the rights granted hereunder or the value thereof. Each Entrant further represents and warrants that he or she has the right to agree to and fully perform consistent with these Official Rules and the consent of no third parties are required to grant the rights hereunder. Entrant further acknowledges and agrees that he/she has not previously granted, assigned or otherwise hypothecated his/her Submission or any images, text and materials depicted therein to any other third party. Further, each Entrant represents and warrants that the Sweepstakes Entities’ use of any Submission or any images, text and materials depicted therein shall not violate an agreement to which such Entrant is a party.

            <br/>
            <br/>
      Prizes are non-transferable, with no cash redemptions, equivalents or substitutions, except as expressly set forth herein and/or at Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion. All prize details not specified in these Official Rules will be determined in Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion. Prize details and availability are subject to change and prize provider’s rules and restrictions, and in the event that Sponsor is unable to provide the winner with his or her prize(s), the Sponsor may elect to provide winners with the approximate value of such item in cash or award an alternate prize of comparable or greater value. In the event a prize winner engages in behavior that (as determined by Sponsor or any prize provider in its or their sole and absolute discretion) is obnoxious, inappropriate, or threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, Sponsor reserves the right to refuse to award the prize to such individual. The prizes are awarded “AS IS” and WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, express or implied, including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Prize winners will be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and for any other fees or costs associated with the prize(s) they receive, regardless of whether the prize(s), in whole or in part, are used. Winners will be responsible for remitting payment of taxes to taxing authorities, and Sponsor has no responsibility therefore. The approximate retail value (“ARV”) of the prizes is based on available information provided to Sponsor and the value of any prize awarded to a winner may be reported for tax purposes as required by law. Prizes, if legitimately claimed, will be awarded. The Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for and will not replace any lost, mutilated or stolen prizes or any prize that is undeliverable or does not reach the winner because of an incorrect or changed address. No more than the stated prizes will be awarded. The winners are strictly prohibited from selling, auctioning, trading or otherwise transferring any part of the prizes. The Sweepstakes Entities are not responsible for and winners will not receive the difference, if any, between the actual value of the prizes at the time of award and the stated ARV in these Official Rules or in any Sweepstakes-related correspondence or material. Prizes will only be mailed to each verified winner’s physical mailing address (no P.O. Boxes), except in Sponsor’s sole and absolute discretion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      <strong>8. WINNER SELECTION AND ODDS:</strong> There will be fifteen (15) winners per Creator, a total of 120 winners in this Sweepstakes. On or about fifteen (15) days after the end of the Entry Period, Administrator will select the potential winners by a random drawing from eligible entries received per Creator (15 from each Creator) during the Entry Period. Maximum one prize per Entrant across all Creators. Entries that are invalid or otherwise do not conform to these Official Rules, as determined by Sponsor or Administrator in their sole discretion, will be deemed ineligible and alternate winner(s) will be selected by random drawing from among the remaining entries. Decisions of the Sponsor and Administrator are final and binding in all matters relating to this Sweepstakes. The odds of winning depend upon the total number of eligible entries received during the Entry Period. Sponsor and Administrator will have complete discretion over interpretation of the Official Rules, of administration of the Sweepstakes, and of selection of the winners.

The required response to such direct message (e.g., full name, mailing address, email address, etc.) must be received within two (2) business days from the time the initial direct message was sent or potential winner will be disqualified, and an alternate potential winner will be selected, time permitting. Sponsor assumes no responsibility for undeliverable email or undeliverable direct message/notification resulting from any form of active or passive filtering by Twitter or for insufficient space in user’s account to receive direct messages. 
            <br/>
      Upon receipt of the requested information, the Potential prize winners will then be contacted by the Administrator and will be required to complete, sign, properly execute, and submit an affidavit of eligibility and liability release, including a consent for publicity purposes (collectively, the “Affidavit”). Such Materials will be sent to the potential winner by Administrator at the time the Entrant is notified in writing he/she is a potential prize winner. Such written notification will also state the deadline by which the Materials must be completed and returned to Administrator.
            <br/>
            <br/>
      <strong><u>Entrants acknowledge that failing to complete and return eligibility Materials in compliance with the written instructions ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE DATE may result in disqualification and, in such case, the prize will be forfeited and awarded to an alternate potential winner, at Sponsor’s sole discretion.</u></strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
      In the event of non-compliance with these rules, or if the prize or prize notification is unclaimed or returned as undeliverable, the prize will be forfeited and, at Administrator’s discretion, awarded to an alternate potential winner. If a prize is won by an eligible individual who is not of the legal age of majority in their state of residence (“minor”), the required documents must be confirmed and signed by minor’s parent or legal guardian, and the prize will be awarded in the name of the parent or legal guardian, who shall fulfill all requirements imposed on the winner set forth herein. If the prize or prize notification is unclaimed or returned as undeliverable, or if any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules, or if the potential prize winner declines a prize for any reason prior to award, such potential winner may be disqualified. In such case, the prize will be forfeited and awarded to an alternate potential winner, at Sponsor’s sole discretion.
